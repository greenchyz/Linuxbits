IO Redirection

3 Standard streams 
standard input STDIN 0
standard output STDOUT 1
standard error STDERR 2


> output direction into file e.g good for making files etc
< input direction into a file e.g  
>> append input into file e.g ehco "forgot text" >> forgot.txt
| pipe standard output into command e.g lsmod | grep nvidia
2> STDERR to null device 2>/dev/null 
2&1>

tee - Tee redirects standard input to both standard output and one or more files.
tr - tr finds-and-replaces one string with another
wc - wc counts characters, lines, and words.
sort - Sorts standard input then outputs the sorted result on standard output.
uniq - Given a sorted stream of data from standard input, it removes duplicate lines of data (i.e., it makes sure that every line is unique).
fmt - Reads text from standard input, then outputs formatted text on standard output.
tr - Translates characters. Can be used to perform tasks such as upper/lowercase conversions or changing line termination characters from one type to another (for example, converting DOS text files into Unix style text files).
sed - Stream editor. Can perform more sophisticated text translations than tr.
awk - An entire programming language designed for constructing filters. Extremely powerful.
